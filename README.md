# RFM-Analysis-SQL

RFM is a marketing research method used to observe and analzye customer value based on Recency, Frequency, and Monentary.

Recency: How recently did the customer purchase?
Frequency: How often did the customer purchase within a given period?
Monetary: What is total amount the customer spent on the products?

In convention, we categorize customer lists into 4 different groups

Recency           Frequency           Monetary
1(most recent)      1(most frequent)    1(highest spend)
2                   2                   2
3                   3                   3
4                   4                   4
